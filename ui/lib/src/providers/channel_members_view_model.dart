/// This class handles the UI Channels business logical for CRUD operations, it
/// ties in with [ChannelApi]. This class extends [BaseModel] which handles
/// [notifyListeners]. When listing widgets are notified using [setState]
/// they will rebuild rendering the new data.
///
/// Each view has it's own model that extends the [ChangeNotifier].
/// Each view only has 2 states. Idle and Busy. Any other piece of UI contained
/// in a view, that requires logic and state / UI updates will have it's own model
/// associated with it. This way the main view only paints when the main view state
/// changes. This Model will work in with [ChannelMembersWidget] as its [Widget]
/// needs access to the models channel data.
///
/// This architecture allows for the abstraction of the business logical from the
/// UI.s
///
/// This design is important for the application as the [NotificationService] will
/// notify the client that new data is available in the database. Please refer to the
/// [NotificationService] for more information about this
